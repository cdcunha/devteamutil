If you must alter the table, do the following. Copy the table to a backup medium. Use DROP AUDIT to remove the audit trail. Delete the audit-trail file. Alter the table. Again, copy the table to a backup medium. Finally, use CREATE AUDIT to start a new audit trail. The first backup is needed to restore the table if a failure occurs while the table is being altered (a lengthy, disk-intensive procedure if the table is large). The second backup is required because, if the table has to be recovered later, the new audit trail must be applied against a backup that has the same layout of columns."},{"Code":-373,"Description":"A database or command script is inaccessible because a DBPATH entry is too long.","Detail":"The database server cannot locate a database or command script using the DBPATH environment variable because one or more of the entries is too long.

The database server must start a log file fresh; it has no means of appending log data to an old log file. An existing log file contains recovery information that may be crucial, so it will not simply empty an existing file. To make a full backup, lock the database, copy all of the database directory to a backup medium, erase the log file (it is no longer needed), and use the START DATABASE statement.
